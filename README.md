# StyleCopCmdLine
StyleCopCmdLine is a wrapper project to make it possible to easily call StyleCop from a command line or a PowerShell script. It is (since 5.0.0.0) build against the version of [StyleCop on GitHub](https://github.com/StyleCop/StyleCop) as opposed to the older version on Codeplex.

For more details on the usage see the [this repo's Wiki](https://github.com/rfennell/StyleCopCmdLine/wiki).

For a discussion of its usage within a TFS 2015 vNext build see [this blog post](http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/rfennell/post/2015/04/03/Running-StyleCop-from-the-command-line-and-in-a-TFS-2015-vNext-build.aspx).

A true TFS vNext build task using this wrapper assembly can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/rfennell/vNextBuild).
